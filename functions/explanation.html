  	<p>A function takes an input and applies some pre-defined rule to determine a particular output. A basic function is something like f(x)=x+3. The input goes inside of the parentheses on the left, and whatever that input is the output is simply the number that is 3 larger. For the function below, drag different inputs into the parentheses to see how the function works.</p>

	f(<span id="function1Input">x</span>)= <span id="function1Output"></span><span id="function1Eval"></span>
	<br />
	<span id="function1Inputs"><span>y</span><span>z</span><span>3</span></span>

	f(<span id="function4Input">x</span>)= <span id="function4Output"></span><span id="function4Eval"></span>
	<br />
	<span id="function4Inputs"><span>&#128348;</span><span>&#128349;</span><span>&#128350;</span></span>

	<p>If we have several functions that might be used simultaneously then we want to be able to quickly and clearly identify the different functions. When f(x)=x+3, the f is simply a way to name one particular function. We could instead say that g(x)=x+3 or tree(x)=x+3 or emoji(x)=x+3. In all of these cases we take the input and add 3.</p>

	f(<span id="function2Input">x</span>)= <span id="function2Output"></span><span id="function2Eval"></span>
	<br />
	<span id="function2Inputs"><span>y</span><span>t</span><span>3</span></span>

	<p>Function composition is when the output of one function is used as the input of a second function.</p>

	f(<span id="function3Input">x</span>)= <span id="function3Output"></span><span id="function3OutputComp"></span><span id="function3Eval"></span>
	<br />
	<span id="function3Inputs"><span name='x+3'>g(x)</span><span name="x-2">h(x)</span><span name="3*x">j(x)</span></span>
	<span id="function3InputsComp"><span>3</span><span>2</span><span>1</span></span>

	<p>Real life functions: f(x)=<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=">'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v='+x</a>. This function takes an input of an 11 character string and outputs a link to a video. Not every string of characters yields an actual video.</p>

	<p>g(x)=x+1 where x is a string of characters and +1 means replacing the last character with the next character in the alphabet.</p>
	g(<span id="function5Input">x</span>)= <span id="function5Output"></span><span id="function5Eval"></span>
	<br />
	<span id="function5Inputs"><span>ysa</span><span>zzt</span><span>abb</span></span>

	<p>You may have noticed that the + symbol appears in both functions and means two different things. In f(x), the + indicates adding more characters to the beginning of the inputted string. In g(x), the + indicates changing the string itself. Mathematically, the + really only means one thing.</p>

	<p>f(g(x))=<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=">'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v='+(x+1)</a>. This function is similar to the previous function, but the last letter of the string is changed forward by one character so o becomes p, etc. The output is still a link to the same video, but the comments and related videos no longer appear on the page.</p>

	<p>g(f(x))=<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=">('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v='+x)+1</a>.</p>

	<p>Can you come up with a function similar to g(x) such that f(g(x)) does not equal g(f(x)). Get creative. There are lots of correct answers.</p>

	<p>For a hint, hover or click the following text: <span class='spoiler'>The function f(x) changes the left of x while g(x) changes the right so they don't really impact each other. Try making g(x) change the left side of x.</span></p>

	This function is similar to the previous function, but the last letter of the string is changed back by one character so p becomes o, etc. If the input is the normal id then this function will likely output a link to an unavailable video.</p>

	<p>What is f(dQw4w9WgXcR)?</p>

	<div id="arrange composition in order to maximize value"></div>

	<p>You don't need to memorize the graphs of every function, but the same functions appear again and again in different situations so knowing approximately how they behave is very beneficial.</p>
