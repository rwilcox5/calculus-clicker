	<p>Precise definition for the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is:<br /> For every e&gt 0, there exists a d&gt 0 such that if |x-a|&lt d then |f(x)-L|&lt e.</p>
	<p>There are 6 unknown values in that definition so we will first handle a slightly easier case. What happens when a=0, L=0, d=2, e=1, and y=f(x)? Then the limit definition looks like:<br /> if |x|&lt 2 then |y|&lt 1.</p> 
	<p>If you are unsure what something means and you see x and y then you should think about what the axis looks like. What does |x|&lt 2 look like?<p>
	<canvas id="canvas1" width=500 height=500></canvas>

	<p>The shaded region between the dashed lines represents all values of x that are less than delta in absolute value.</p>
	<p>The limit definition tells us that when x is in that shaded region then |y|&lt 1. What does |y|&lt 1 look like?</p>
	<canvas id="canvas2" width=500 height=500></canvas>

	<p>The shaded region between the dashed lines represents all values of y that are less than epsilon in absolute value.</p>
	<p>The limit definition tells us that when x is in the first shaded region then y is in the second shaded region. We can ignore all values of x outside of the first shaded region because they are irrelevant to the limit definition. However, when the function is in that vertical stripe then it must also be entirely contained in the horizontal stripe. The result is that the function cannot ever pass through the dark shaded regions below.</p>
	<canvas id="canvas3" width=500 height=500></canvas>

	<p>We can draw a box around the point with width twice delta and height twice epsilon. Then the limit definition states that the function can never be directly above or below the box. The function can do whatever it wants to the left and right, but inside that vertical stripe the function must not get too high or too low.</p>
	<p>Now that we have seen 1 particular example we can change epsilon and delta to see what happens.</p>
	<canvas id="canvas4" width=500 height=500></canvas>
	<input type="range" min="0" max="50" value="20" class="slider" id="myDelta">
	<input type="range" min="0" max="50" value="10" class="slider" id="myEpsilon">

	<p>At this point we do not know anything about the function except that it passes through the origin. But as you make epsilon smaller you should notice that the area to avoid gets bigger and bigger. Whatever the function is (unless the function is always equal to zero), at some point epsilon will be so small that the function will pass into the bad zones if the value of delta is fixed. If delta is getting smaller at the same time that epsilon gets smaller then hopefully the bad zones will get skinny enough to prevent the function from entering them. That is why delta needs to be a function of epsilon. Now let delta be a function of epsilon and change the value of epsilon.</p>
	<canvas id="canvas5" width=500 height=500></canvas>
	<input type="text" id="myDelta2" value="2*e">
	<input type="range" min="0" max="50" value="10" class="slider" id="myEpsilon2">

	<p>We need to be able to express delta as a function of epsilon so that the function does not enter the bad region generated by every value of epsilon greater than 0. Now the function to generate delta depends on the original function that we are taking the limit of so we have done as much as we can without that information. In an ideal world, the value of delta would be as large as possible, but in order to satisfy the limit definition the delta just needs to be larger than 0. So we do not need to completely solve for the optimal delta, but we can get creative and pick an easier to find delta that we know works. </p>
	<p>For example, consider the function f(x)=x^5+x. We want to prove that the limit as x approaches 0 is actually 0. We need to find a delta for every epsilon greater than 0 such that if |x-a|&lt d then |f(x)-L|&lt e. If we just focus on the positive values of x then we know that as x gets larger so does x^5 and thus the largest that f(x) will be is when x=d. So we need f(d) to be less than e so we worry about the inequality e>d^5+d.</p>
	<p> If we let e=d^5+d and solve for the positive value of d that satisfies the equation in terms of epsilon then we can use that function for our value of delta. But solving a 5th degree equation is hard. Instead we will try to find another function for d so that e is always larger than d^5+d. </p>
	<p>When a number is between 0 and 1, we must remember that raising the number to the 5th power actually makes the number smaller. Thus, if e=d^5+d then e is actually only slightly larger than d for small values of e. What would happen if we just let d=e. Then d^5+d=e^5+e, which is larger than e for positive values of e. But for small values of e we are actually close to where we want to be. What is the easiest way to make delta smaller while keeping it greater than 0? We could let d=e/2. Then d^5+d=e^5/32+e/2. As long as e^5/32 is less than e/2 then the sum will be less than e. When e&lt 2, e^5/32&lt e/2 so d^5+d is less than e.</p>
	<p>Let d=min(1,e/2).</p>


	<canvas id="canvas6" width=500 height=500></canvas>
	<input type="text" id="myDelta3" value="2*e">
	<input type="range" min="1" max="500" value="100" class="slider" id="myEpsilon3">
	<input type="range" min="1" max="500" value="100" class="slider" id="zoom3">

	<p>Now that we know what to do when considering the limit around the origin, we must worry about other points. The pictures are the same just shifted around the axis, but the arithmetic is generally more complicated. Use the same f(x)=x^5+x, but now consider the limit as x approaches 2. Let's revisit the limit definition: for every e&gt 0, there exists a d&gt 0 such that if |x-a|&lt d then |f(x)-L|&lt e. Now a=2 and L=34 because 2^5+2=34.</p>

	<p>All of that is a precise way of saying that when x is about 2 then f(x) is about 34. So f(x) cannot be too big so when is f(x) at its largest? The bigger x is the bigger f(x) is so when x is less than delta away from 2, f(x) is at its largest when x is very close to 2+d. So we must determine what f(2+d) is. After expanding we know that f(2+d)=2^5+5*2^4*d+10*2^3*d^2+10*2^2*d^3+5*2*d^4+d^5+2+d. What we want is for f(2+d)-34 to be smaller than epsilon and f(2+d)-34=5*2^4*d+10*2^3*d^2+10*2^2*d^3+5*2*d^4+d^5+d. When is that expression less than epsilon? This expression might seem intimidating because of the 5th power and greek letter, but we have one valuable tool to use: we get to choose how small delta is. So we can make delta small enough that the inequality is easy to work with. When delta is bigger than 1 the powers of delta will cause problems so the first thing we can do is simply decide that we never want delta to be bigger than 1. Let d=min(1,g(e)) where g(e) is some function we need to determine. Then we only need to focus on what happens to this expression when d&lt 1.</p>
	<p>When d&lt 1 we know that raising d to a power greater than 1 makes the number smaller so d^2, d^3, d^4, and d^5 are all less than d. So we can greatly simplify the inequality because we know that 5*2^4*d+10*2^3*d^2+10*2^2*d^3+5*2*d^4+d^5+d&lt 5*2^4*d+10*2^3*d+10*2^2*d+5*2*d+d+d. Then we can add up all of the d's to get 5*2^4*d+10*2^3*d+10*2^2*d+5*2*d+d+d=212*d. So now we know that f(x)&lt 212*d when x is within delta of 2. All we need to do is guarantee that 212*d&lt e. So we declare that d=e/250. We could use any number larger than 212 instead of 250, but 250 is a nice round number that works-you can use another number if you prefer. We do need to remember that we need d&lt 1 to make this inequality work so really d=min(1,e/250). You should check that d=1 is small enough when e>250.</p>
	<p>Of course we are not done yet because all we have done is establish that f(x)&lt 34+e so we also need to ensure that f(x)&gt 34-e when x is around 2. I will leave this exercise to you, but the idea is the same. Use f(2-d) and then make d small enough to make the inequality work. Be careful with the negative signs!</p>
