	<p>Precise definition for the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is:<br /> For every e&gt 0, there exists a d&gt 0 such that if |x-a|&lt d then |f(x)-L|&lt e.</p>
	<p>There are 6 unknown values in that definition so we will first handle a slightly easier case. What happens when a=0, L=0, d=2, e=1, and y=f(x)? Then the limit definition looks like:<br /> if |x|&lt 2 then |y|&lt 1.</p> 
	<p>If you are unsure what something means and you see x and y then you should think about what the axis looks like. What does |x|&lt 2 look like?<p>
	<canvas id="canvas1" width=500 height=500></canvas>

	<p>The shaded region between the dashed lines represents all values of x that are less than delta in absolute value.</p>
	<p>The limit definition tells us that when x is in that shaded region then |y|&lt 1. What does |y|&lt 1 look like?</p>
	<canvas id="canvas2" width=500 height=500></canvas>

	<p>The shaded region between the dashed lines represents all values of y that are less than epsilon in absolute value.</p>
	<p>The limit definition tells us that when x is in the first shaded region then y is in the second shaded region. We can ignore all values of x outside of the first shaded region because they are irrelevant to the limit definition. However, when the function is in that vertical stripe then it must also be entirely contained in the horizontal stripe. The result is that the function cannot ever pass through the dark shaded regions below.</p>
	<canvas id="canvas3" width=500 height=500></canvas>

	<p>We can draw a box around the point with width twice delta and height twice epsilon. Then the limit definition states that the function can never be directly above or below the box. The function can do whatever it wants to the left and right, but inside that vertical stripe the function must not get too high or too low.</p>
	<p>Now that we have seen 1 particular example we can change epsilon and delta to see what happens.</p>
	<canvas id="canvas4" width=500 height=500></canvas>
	<input type="range" min="0" max="50" value="20" class="slider" id="myDelta">
	<input type="range" min="0" max="50" value="10" class="slider" id="myEpsilon">

	<p>At this point we do not know anything about the function except that it passes through the origin. But as you make epsilon smaller you should notice that the area to avoid gets bigger and bigger. Whatever the function is (unless the function is always equal to zero), at some point epsilon will be so small that the function will pass into the bad zones if the value of delta is fixed. If delta is getting smaller at the same time that epsilon gets smaller then hopefully the bad zones will get skinny enough to prevent the function from entering them. That is why delta needs to be a function of epsilon. Now let delta be a function of epsilon and change the value of epsilon.</p>
	<canvas id="canvas5" width=500 height=500></canvas>
	<input type="text" id="myDelta2" value="2*e">
	<input type="range" min="0" max="50" value="10" class="slider" id="myEpsilon2">

	<p>We need to be able to express delta as a function of epsilon so that the function does not enter the bad region generated by every value of epsilon greater than 0. Now the function to generate delta depends on the original function that we are taking the limit of so we have done as much as we can without that information. In an ideal world, the value of delta would be as large as possible, but in order to satisfy the limit definition the delta just needs to be larger than 0.</p>
