  	How do you solve for x?

	<p>You are presented an equation and asked to solve for x. What can you do to the equation so that you can determine the value of x? You can do two types of things: change both sides of the equation equally or modify one side so that is still the same but looks different.</p>

	<p>Change both sides equally. You can add the same amount to both sides. Or you can multiply both sides by the same amount. Those are the most common ways to change both sides. Other possibilities are taking a logarithm of both sides, raising both sides to the same exponent, or using both sides as the exponent with the same base. You can use other functions, but need to be careful about domains and such things. Be careful that every time you change one side that you completely change the entirety of both sides.</p>

	<p>If you are constantly making mistakes then make sure that you know exactly what you are doing at each step. If you follow the above rules then you can get as creative as you want and still end up with equality.</p>

	<p>Get everything involving x to one side of the equation. Then remove everything that doesn't involve x from that side. If something contains x stuff and not-x stuff then separate them. If lots of things contain x then combine them.</p>

	<p>Want to do PEMDAS backwards. Everything should be simplified so the last thing to do is the first thing you want to undo. Just like directions. I started at home, went 2 blocks north, then 3 blocks east, then 4 miles south and ended at school. Where do I live? Well, travel 4 miles north then 3 blocks west then 2 blocks south. Similarly if (x+1)^2-4=32. What is x? Well I started with x and then added 1. And then squared that. And then subtracted 4 and ended up at 32. Thus to get x, I start at 32 and then add 4 and then take a square root. And then subtract 1. So the first thing to do is to undo the last part of PEMDAS. Identify terms and factors.</p>
	<p>Is there a + or - outside of parentheses? If so, you've got some terms. Else, is there a * or / outside of parentheses? If so, you've got factors. Else, is it something to a power. Else, undo the last function.</p>

	<p>Modify how one side looks without changing its value. You can distribute products, factor terms, or substitute equal values.</p>
	<p>If it is not possible to simply undo operations until x is all alone then you may need to change the form of one or both sides of the equation. If you are only changing one side then the change must be purely cosmetic. If you have A=B and do something to make the equation C=B then A and C need to be equivalent.</p>
	<p>For example, take 4(x+3)=2(x+1). There is an x on both sides so it is not clear which x to solve for. You could start dividing and subtracting until you have solved for x. As long as you properly do the same thing to both sides you should get the same answer no matter what order you do things. However, especially if you do not like fractions then you can change how each side looks first. Distribute the multiplication through the parentheses. So the left side becomes 4x+12 and the right side becomes 2x+2. Now our equation is 4x+12=2x+2, but we haven't changed anything other than how each side looks. Now we solve by undoing the sums and then undoing the multiplications. We get x=-5.</p>
	<p>Distribution is a common need. If you have a set of parentheses with multiple terms and at least one of the terms includes x and at least one does not include x then you are probably going to have to distribute at some point.</p>
